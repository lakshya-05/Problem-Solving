Solutions of HackerRank Problem Solving questions

- Here I Lakshya Porwal will be uploading Solutions of Problem Solving questions from HackerRank website.
- All the solutions will be in Python Language itself.
- The solutions I'm provinding with will be in the order I solved the problems. 

##
## Solve Me First
- Use "return a+b".

##
## Simple Array Sum
- Add all the elements of the given list and return the sum.

##
## Compare The Triplets

##
## Diagonal Difference
- First, add all the elements which are at i=j index number (Ex- at (0,0),(1,1),(2,2)...etc).
- Then, add all the elements which are at i=n-j-1 index number (Ex- at (0,2),(1,1),(2,0)...etc).

##
## Plus Minus
- For first line of output, count number of positive elements in the list and divide by total elements of list.
- Print the output upto 6 decimals.
- For second line of output, count number of negative elements in the list and divide by total elements of list.
- Print the output upto 6 decimals.
- For last line of output, count number of zeros in the list and divide by total elements of list.
- Print the output upto 6 decimals.

##
## Staircase
- Use nested for loop for printing the desired pattern.
